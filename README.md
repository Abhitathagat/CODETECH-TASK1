Overview of Task One: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the California Housing dataset. EDA is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the data, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, and forming hypotheses for further analysis.

Dataset:
The California Housing dataset includes various features related to housing in California, such as average house age, average number of rooms, average number of bedrooms, population, average occupation, and median income. The target variable is the median house price.

Key Goals:

1.Understand Data Characteristics:

Gain insights into the basic structure and statistics of the dataset.
Assess the distribution of the features and target variable.
Identify Data Quality Issues:

2.Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Detect and analyze outliers.
Explore Relationships:

3.Examine relationships between different features and the target variable.
Identify potential correlations and interactions.
Visualize Data:

4.Use various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to represent the data visually.
Make data-driven insights more intuitive and easier to interpret.

Outcome:
By completing this EDA project, you will develop a deeper understanding of the California Housing dataset, which will serve as a foundation for any subsequent data modeling and machine learning tasks. The visualizations and insights obtained from EDA will help guide your approach to building predictive models and making informed decisions based on the data.
